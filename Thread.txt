Thread: Entity with in the process that can be scheduled

A process can spawn multiple threads

+ All threads within a process share same memory.
+ Lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process.
+ Great for I/O bound task(when interactin with disk)

- Only one thread allowed as per GIL
- Not killable or interruptable
- No effect for CPU bound task
- careful with race condition
